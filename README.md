## How to

After running `go build`, executable file `devops` is made

1. Copy the executable to your PATH folder, for example: `cp devops /usr/local/bin`
2. Move to your DevOps project folder
3. `devops setup` will create a `config.json` file and then `devops builds` will print the last project builds

## TODO

[x] Make go package installable thorugh brew or apt
